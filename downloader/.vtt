00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:03.587
Danny Pink.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.722
Is dead.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.467
We're here to get your boyfriend back
from the dead.

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.890
These are tombs. Water tombs.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.721
Why would anyone go to so much trouble?

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:17.943
You're dead.
And this is what's next.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.530
A Galyfreyan hard drive.
Time Lord technology.

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.493
Do you know the key strategic weakness
of the human race?

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.575
The dead outnumber the living

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.912
Who are you?

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.707
Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.495
I couldn't very well keep calling myself

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.043
the Master, now could I?

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.644
Stop! You can't kill me!

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:53.895
Incorrect.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.936
I'm a target of strategic value.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.808
Alive, I'm a tactical advantage.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.895
Dead, I'm your biggest mistake.
You don't know who I am!

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.154
You are Clara Oswald. You are human.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.068
You are unimportant.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.289
Incorrect.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.867
You see, that is what
you're supposed to think.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.668
That is what everybody thinks.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.666
You are Clara Oswald.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.585
Clara Oswald is a cover story,
a disguise.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.215
There is no Clara Oswald.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.382
- Identify.
- Oh, don't be so slow,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.593
it's embarrassing.
Who could fool you like this?

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.342
Who could hide right under your nose?

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.056
Who can change their face
any time they want?

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.358
You see, I'm not Clara Oswald.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.398
Clara Oswald has never existed.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:43.900
Identify.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.402
I'm the Doctor.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.271
Look at them...

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.064
My boys!

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.404
Cybermen, in broad daylight?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.447
You think people won't notice?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.619
Photos with the big
metal men, one pound!

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.247
Oh, honey!

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.257
There you go!

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.634
New York, Paris, Rome,
Marrakech, Brisbane, Glasgow.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.758
Everywhere. Anywhere. Me and my boys.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.931
We're going viral.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.474
Would you like me to take a picture?

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.897
Sorry, selfies are never
as good, are they,

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.645
and you're having
a lovely moment, hang on!

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.111
- Nice bow tie.
- Bow ties are cool.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.315
Big smiles, and... Now!

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.572
Move, move, move!

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.656
Surround target! Hold fast!

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.576
Afternoon!

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.128
You've picked a lovely day for it.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.664
My, don't you look shiny.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.999
Haircut?

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.047
- Bit of a trim.
- Might want to do your roots.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.049
- The woman!
- Yes, ma'am.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.343
Kate Stewart. Divorcee, mother of two,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.474
keen gardener,
outstanding bridge player.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:39.144
Also chief scientific officer,
Unified Intelligence Task Force,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.721
who currently have you surrounded.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.058
Human weaponry is not effective
against Cyber technology.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.065
Sorry, you left this behind
on one of your previous attempts.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.155
So, now that I have your attention,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.449
welcome to the only planet
in the universe

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.117
where we get to say this.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.528
- He's on the payroll.
- Am I?

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:58.990
Well, technically.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.540
- How much?
- Shh!

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:01.791
Any questions?

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.584
Back, back, everyone, back!

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.395
Oh, my God!

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:25.312
- Is it supposed to do that?
- Is that new?

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.485
The sun roof on St Paul's?
Yeah, I'd say that was new!

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.692
There's going to be mass panic,
everyone in London can see that.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.948
Everyone in London
just clapped and went whee!

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.367
Hush, I'm trying to count.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.111
Eighty-seven, I think.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:38.820
OCD.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.495
Ninety-one. Queen of Evil.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.203
How could St Paul's be full of
91 Cybermen and nobody noticed?

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.381
Dimensional engineering
one space folded inside another,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.382
bigger on the inside.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.545
Easy if you're a Time Lord.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.593
Mostly deploying south,
a smaller number east.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.264
- Yep, but one straight up.
- So, 91 isn't a coincidence?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.518
Of course, it isn't.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.437
Osgood, 91, explain.

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:07.141
Ninety-one areas of significant
population density in the British Isles.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.856
That's one Cyberman
for every city and major town.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.021
It's happening everywhere,
all over the world, right now!

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.065
Sweet planet, this.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.567
I think I might keep it.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.779
One Cyberman per city,
what can they hope to accomplish?

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.370
Doctor!

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.121
- Has it exploded?
- More than that.

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:32.921
Cybermen don't just blow themselves up
for no good reason, dear.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.088
They're not human.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.419
If it isn't exploding, what's it doing?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.552
Pollinating.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.715
Falling like rain
into the cracks of the earth.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.230
Well, this is a bit exciting!

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.527
What's happening?

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.616
Well, to cut a long story short,

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.236
looks like we might all be going home.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.029
Home?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.748
From the afterlife?

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.957
Well, when I said afterlife,
I was being a tiny bit poetic.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.750
And Nethersphere is just a cool name

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.673
we came up with during a spit-ball.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.592
What is this place?

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.755
Well, you've to think of it
as a data cloud.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.218
You know, for storing data.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:24.973
In this case, storage of recently
deceased minds.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.771
- We're in a cloud?
- A sort of cloud, yeah.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.356
And what's happening to it?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:33.277
What happens to any cloud
when it starts to rain.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.729
Are you telling me we're going back?

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:36.859
What, back to our bodies?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.658
And the extra good news is,

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.531
there's been a bit of an upgrade!

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.413
The dead are coming home, Doctor.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.749
All shiny and new.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.879
In 24 hours, the human race,
as you know it, will cease to exist.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.332
What are you doing? Explain!

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.210
- Tell me, now!
- Ooh! That was nice.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.468
Let's do it again.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.721
No, no, no, no, I need to talk to her,
I need her awake.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.300
Ahh! No!

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.182
No, stupid!

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.389
Stupid, no, no!

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.522
First protocol is implemented,
we're good to go.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.448
You just have to let it take you...

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.741
What did he say?

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.586
He said, guard the graveyards.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.018
That's weird. Look at that!

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.238
How come it's only raining
inside the graveyard?

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.643
We are being told that

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.024
these metal men
are known as 'Cybermen,'

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.731
but unlike the accounts
we have on file,

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.325
they now have the ability to fly.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.870
Similar reports are coming in
from all over the world.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.449
Flying Cybermen are here
on a global scale.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.661
Ministers are telling us
to remain calm.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.580
These Cybermen don't seem
to be attacking us,

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.749
at least not in any
conventional fashion.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.382
Eye witnesses have reported seeing...

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.221
Hello?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.107
Hello?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.611
Whoa!

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.253
Put it in position.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.338
Right.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.090
Careful with it.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.149
Kate? What's with the hand cuffs?

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.156
I'm sorry. In the event of
an alien incursion on this scale,

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.704
protocols are in place.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.248
Your co-operation is to be ensured
and your unreliability assumed.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.543
- You have a history.
- You don't have a future without me.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.378
Do you think your father
would have done this?

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.501
We both know he absolutely would.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.541
Who is she?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.418
Long story. Where's Clara?

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.928
- Clara Oswald, your assistant?
- My friend.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:31.472
- She was with me in St Paul's.
- The team's still on site.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.425
But they've been unable to gain
access to the building.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.977
I want her found and brought here.
I need her with me.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.269
Then give the order.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.849
As soon as you're on board Boat One,
your word is law. Quite literally.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.818
You got the Tardis out though?

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.899
Yes. And St Paul's locked down.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.657
Where are we going? Cloudbase?

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.708
- You mean the Valiant.
- Cloud base was Thunderbirds'.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.042
Too conspicuous. We need your location
concealed, not advertised.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.543
From now on you're a moving target.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.050
Ah, so you're bringing Daddy along too,
that's very sweet.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:08.968
Sir!

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.596
Don't do that, you look like
you're self-concussing,

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.973
which would explain all
of military history,

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.641
now I think about it.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.927
Colonel Ahmed, sir.
Privilege to meet you.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.893
Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed,
are you in the Scouts?

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.974
Are you a Man Scout?
I didn't know they had those.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.395
- It was Captain Scarlet.
- Sorry?

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:30.231
- Not Thunderbirds.
- Oh, God, so it was.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.943
My confidence is growing every minute.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.403
The President is on board.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:38.411
Mind you, me and Sylvia Anderson,
you've never seen a foxtrot like it.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.914
Hang on a second. The President?

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.080
We don't want Americans
bobbing around the place.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.506
They'll only start praying.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:50.006
Not the President of America, sir.
The President of Earth.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.174
- There isn't one.
- There is now.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.722
The incursion protocols have been
agreed internationally.

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.799
In the event of full-scale invasion,
an Earth president

00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.433
is inducted immediately, with complete
authority over every nation state.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:02.388
Well, there was only one
practical candidate.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.066
Oh, that's your answer for everything,
isn't it? Vote for an idiot.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.352
If you say so, Mr President.

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.730
So long as you're on this plane,
you are the Commander in Chief

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.314
of every army on Earth.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.946
Every world leader
is currently awaiting your instructions.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:17.279
You are the Chief Executive Officer
of the human race.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.330
Any questions?

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:22.249
This is your Captain speaking,
please prepare for take-off.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.501
Well, gentlemen. Where to start?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.628
I was born on the planet Gallifrey,
in the constellation of Kasterborous.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.880
I am a Time Lord,
but my Prydonian privileges were revoked

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.678
when I stole a time
capsule and ran away.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.130
Currently piloting a Type 40 Tardis.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.510
I have been married four times,
all deceased.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.683
My children and grandchildren
are missing, and I assume, dead.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.307
I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter,
created via genetic transfer.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.185
How much more do you need?
I'm the Doctor!

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:48.272
This information is not proof.
We require proof.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.196
- How about my name?
- Explain.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.155
Well, my name isn't Doctor, is it?

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.618
I don't even really have a doctorate.
Well, Glasgow University,

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.162
but then I accidentally graduated
in the wrong century, so technically...

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.660
This information cannot be confirmed.

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.868
- You are Clara Oswald.
- Ah! No, I'm not.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.208
Your deception is intended
to prolong your life.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.167
Your presence has not been ordered.
Correct.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.594
- You are Clara Oswald.
- Oh, seriously, this is getting old.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.722
Look, there is no Clara Oswald.
I invented her. I made her up.

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.846
Born 23rd November, 1986.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.599
Yeah, I chose that date.
I always liked it.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.850
Father, David James Oswald.
Mother, Elena Alison Oswald.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:31.068
Stories. Stories. Stories.
I made them up.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.197
Look, ask anybody who knows me.
I'm an incredible liar.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.322
Correct.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.199
- No order was given.
- Correct.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.580
You are not under Cyber control.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.128
Correct.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.808
Why are you still alive?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.979
- You saved me.
- I saved Gallifrey.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.818
Yes, Gallifrey, too, I suppose.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:20.494
There's always collateral damage,
with you and me. It's our Paris.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.956
Gallifrey is lost in another dimension.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.117
Yes and no.

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.212
- Meaning?
- Yes, it's in another dimension.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.169
No, it's not lost.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:36.801
You know where it is?

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.927
Yep. You know the best part
about knowing?

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.802
Not telling you.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.772
Mr President, sir,
we're ready for you up here.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.735
Remember all those years, when all you
wanted to do was to rule the world?

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.905
- On my way.
- Thank you, Mr President.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.028
Piece of cake.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.714
Oh, erm. It's her little device thingy.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.133
I thought there might be
useful information on it.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.460
Who is she?

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.378
You'd never believe me if I told you.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.640
Because I thought she might be
the Master regenerated into female form.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.308
Your childhood friend, responsible
for a number of previous incursions.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:30.513
That was fairly quick.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.065
We do have files on
all our ex-prime ministers.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.109
Oh, she wasn't even the worst.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.027
Doctor, there's something
nobody's talking about.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.275
Which is?

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.482
The clouds, caused by
the exploding Cybermen...

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.909
They haven't dispersed,
they're still there.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.867
In fact they have expanded and
are covering almost all the land masses.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.868
We're all looking at the graveyards.
Maybe we should be looking up.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.587
What do you think?

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.176
- All of time and space.
- I'm sorry.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.553
Just something for your bucket list.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.484
Localised rain in
the cemeteries has resulted in

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:28.993
what can only be described as
disturbances to the soil.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.324
Extraordinary eye witnesses accounts

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.501
are claiming that silver creatures
are climbing from the graves.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.078
These scenes are being
repeated everywhere.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.711
Every cemetery. Every mortuary,
every funeral home. Every hospital.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.757
The dead are returning to life
as Cybermen.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:44.425
The public are being advised to
stay away from all cemeteries,

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.474
Hello?

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.243
Hello?

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.009
We've done heat scans
of some of the cemeteries

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.342
and in each case, only a handful
of Cybermen have so far emerged

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.644
but every individual burial site
is active.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.516
Active? Hatching.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:19.015
More are coming. Potentially millions.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.855
So the rain caused all that
in just a few hours?

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.988
It wasn't rain, Man Scout!
It was pollen. Cyber-pollen.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.408
Every tiny particle of a Cyberman

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.618
contains the plans
to make another Cyberman.

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.700
All it has to do is make a contact
with compatible,

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.453
living organic matter,
and bang, full conversion.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:41.212
But if they've learned
how to convert the dead...

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.132
That's what she was doing!

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.298
That's what 3W was for!

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.340
She creates an all new paranoia
among the super-rich about dying,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.810
she exploits the wealth
and the mortal remains

00:18:55.885 --> 00:19:00.982
of selected idiots, so she can create
a whole new race of Cybermen.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.231
Cybermen who can recruit corpses.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.946
Throw away your guns, Man Scout,
it's all over.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:12.452
How can you win a war against an enemy
that can weaponise the dead?

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.819
They're not attacking apart from
isolated incidents,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.283
they're just wandering about.

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:54.281
They're new-borns.
Give them time.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.408
Why were you there this morning,
why were you already attacking?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.453
Been investigating 3W for a while.
Then we got a tip off.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.159
From a woman with a Scottish accent.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.870
Can't play to the gallery,
unless there's a gallery. And here I am.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.381
Dead bodies don't have minds,
of course.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:11.006
But she's been upgrading dying minds
to a hard drive for a long time.

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:12.837
So, she upgrades the hardware,

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.388
then she updates the software.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.345
What do you mean,
a long time? How long?

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.973
She must have a Tardis somewhere.
So, as long as she likes,

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.850
-the past and future...
- How long, Doctor?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.024
How long has the human race
had a concept of an afterlife?

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.486
Turns out the afterlife is real.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.821
And it's emptying.

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:33.611
Every graveyard on planet Earth

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.027
is about to burst its banks.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.624
Hey, Missy, you're so fine,
you're so fine,

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.709
you blow my mind.
Hey, Missy!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.215
Hey...

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.295
Excuse me.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.301
Hi.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.890
Can I tell you something
really important?

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:00.009
What?

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.687
I have to whisper it.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.025
It's, like, so important
to everyone on this plane,

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:10.399
that you'll get in trouble
if you don't listen.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.108
If it was that important,
why would you tell us?

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.815
Well, look at me, I'm bananas.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.324
Come on, just a wee bit closer.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.991
Just a little closer, you know,
the Doctor will be really impressed

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.072
if you learn my secrets.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.002
Well, you can come a bit closer
than that. Stop mucking about.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.210
Don't be shy.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.967
You don't smell half as bad
as you think you do.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.347
There are two armed men
directly behind you.

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:43.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.354
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.987
I'm going to kill you
in a minute.

00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.489
I'm not even kidding,

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:02.117
you're gonna be as dead
as a fish on a slab any second now,

00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:04.073
all floppy and making smells.

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.041
But don't tell the boys,

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.627
this is our secret girl plan.

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.422
Why would you bother killing me?
I'm not even important.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:15.172
Oh, silly! Why does one pop a balloon?

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.257
Because you're pretty.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.802
You should have a bit
more confidence in yourself.

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:22.299
Okay.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.180
Sorry, I've got work to do.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.308
All right fine, you get on.

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.059
You get that finished.

00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:30.732
Would a countdown help you
focus at all?

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.230
- No, that's okay.
- Ten.

00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:33.485
Don't be scared yet, 'cause I'm still

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.608
- in double figures.
- I'm not scared.

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.985
Nine. Of course you're not,
because you know you're dying anyway.

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:40.485
Eight. Human beings are born dying.
Your life spans are hilarious.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:41.865
Please be quiet.

00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:45.118
Seven. You know,
from the minute you slop out

00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.874
you're rotting, decaying.

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:49.793
The stench of you. Oof!

00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:51.621
I'm never going to get
this place clean.

00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:53.414
- Three!
- Three?

00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.458
I'm accelerating for dramatic effect.

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:56.880
Oh!

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.883
What's that in your pocket?

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:02.798
There's nothing in my...

00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.806
Oh, my giddy aunt.

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.638
The quiet ones are the worst.

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:10.723
Well, those aren't mine!

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:18.572
Then they must be mine!

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.612
Say something nice.

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:27.285
Missy! The Master!

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:30.959
Whatever you call yourself. I promise,
I'm much more useful to you alive.

00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:33.917
Oh, yeah, that's true.
That's definitely true,

00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:36.124
that is a good point, well made...

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:38.755
I'm proud of you, sister.
But did I mention?

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:40.510
Bananas!

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.425
Pop!

00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.553
Ah!

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:48.511
Thanks for being yummy.

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:07.287
Mr President, you need
to get back in your seat.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:09.406
I don't like being President,
people keep saluting.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.083
I'm never going to salute back.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.748
You know, that was always
my Dad's big ambition,

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.292
to get you to salute him, just once.

00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:19.375
He should've asked.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.715
- Doctor, what are you looking at?
- The clouds.

00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:28.930
Still there, so what else
have they got?

00:24:30.678 --> 00:24:31.770
Oh, dear Lord!

00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:33.472
There's a Cyberman
out there on the fuselage.

00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:35.808
On the plus side, it's not turbulence.

00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:38.770
She's out!

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:40.688
Who let her out?

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.194
What's it doing? Where did it go?

00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:45.910
What can one Cyberman do to a plane?

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:10.009
Oh, she was really scared,
it was classic!

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:15.306
Have you got any more friends
I can play with?

00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:41.711
Are you the one that brought me here?

00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.296
Affirmative.

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:45.928
- So you know who I am, right?
- You are not the Doctor.

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:49.303
Of course, I'm not the Doctor,
I was lying to stay alive.

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.050
But how do I know so much about him?

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.352
- You are his associate-
- I'm not.

00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:55.270
I'm not his associate,

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.313
I'm his best friend.

00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:00.067
Right now, his best friend,
anywhere in the universe.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.477
Have you got any sort of
Cyber-Internet in there,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.813
because really, you should look it up.

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:06.191
Look up what happens to you
if you harm me.

00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:08.401
Where is the Doctor?

00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:11.487
What, you think I'd give up the Doctor?
Don't be daft.

00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:15.454
I would never, ever,
give up the Doctor.

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.535
Because he is my best friend, too.

00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:20.041
He is closest person to me
in this whole world.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.918
He's the man I will always forgive,

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:25.126
always trust, the one man
I would never, ever lie to...

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:52.819
Danny?

00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:56.206
Danny Pink is dead.

00:26:58.117 --> 00:26:59.369
Help me.

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:01.913
Oh, my God!

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.168
Danny!

00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:10.967
- Help me.
- Danny!

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.265
I'm so sorry.

00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:16.302
Help me! I need you
to do something for me.

00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:18.725
I can't do it myself.

00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:27.024
What is that?

00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:28.693
It's an inhibitor.

00:27:28.856 --> 00:27:30.574
It's not activated.

00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:32.235
I need you to switch it on.

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:34.240
What does it inhibit?

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.365
Emotion. It deletes emotions.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.001
Please, I don't want to feel like this.

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:51.128
- There's more than one.
- What?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.843
They're all over the plane,
they're pulling it apart!

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.304
Whoa!

00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.770
- Ask me.
- Shut up!

00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.775
Ask me! Go on, you know you want to.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.818
You want to know what my plan is.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.403
You'll be surprised.

00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:10.652
I got a gift for you.

00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.826
You know, I've been
up and down your time line,

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.872
meeting all those silly people
who die to keep you alive.

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.539
You know what I worked out?

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.201
- What you really need?
- For what?

00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:24.044
To know that you're just like me.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:25.871
Oh!

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.003
And now it begins.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.629
Doctor, I do believe you're on call.

00:28:34.338 --> 00:28:36.306
Miss Oswald expects.

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:40.390
Who else? But the girl
who's got your number.

00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:42.596
Whoops!

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:47.900
It was you!

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:53.281
- Ah! Hello!
- Where did you get this number?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.987
The woman in the shop wrote it down,

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.114
it's a helpline, isn't it?

00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:58.286
Computer helpline, love!

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:00.326
That's the one.

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:03.333
Best helpline in the universe.

00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:07.204
You put us together.

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:09.001
I kept you together.

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.129
- Who put that advert in the paper?
- Who gave you my number?

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.211
The woman, the woman in the shop.

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:17.257
And there's a woman out there
who is very keen that we stay together.

00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:20.684
- Why?
- Because she's perfect, innt?

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:24.646
The control freak and the man
who should never be controlled.

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.355
You'd go to hell, if she asked.
And she would.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.690
The phone's ringing, Doctor.
Can't you hear that?

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.989
Now, that is the sound
of your chain being yanked.

00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:35.782
Heel, Doctor!

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.862
Help me Doctor!

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.368
Help me, help me, Doctor!

00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:44.290
- Clara?
- Doctor?

00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:48.416
- With Danny.
- Danny's dead, Clara.

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:50.418
Not yet. Not quite.

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.169
But he wants to be.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:53.796
Clara?

00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.218
Clara?

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:03.848
He's a Cyberman.

00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:06.180
Doctor, Danny's a Cyberman.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.605
And he's crying.
Doctor, he feels it, he's crying.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:19.326
Message to Geneva.
Tell them Boat One is going down,

00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:21.244
we don't anticipate survivors.

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:32.752
Clara, don't do it, just don't do it!

00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:36.294
It's in his chest,
he says it's an inhibitor.

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:37.753
It can delete emotion, or something...

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.425
I know what it does.

00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:42.345
If you turn it on,
he'll become a Cyberman.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.642
- He's already a Cyberman.
- Not yet, he isn't.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:48.981
He's hurting because I hurt him.
And he wants it to stop.

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:50.933
Stop the pain, and he'll kill you!

00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:55.980
Look, are you going to help me
because I can't do this alone?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.278
I am not going to help
you commit suicide.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.905
Look the Tardis can home in
on this call, right?

00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:03.954
Either you help me,
or you leave me alone.

00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:06.866
Clara, no!

00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.339
There's a lot of switches
round the edge.

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:16.382
I'm just going to try pressing them all.

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:17.835
Okay.

00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:29.013
I am so sorry.

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:31.264
Yeah.

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:36.645
Doctor! The Cybermen are in,
the plane's going down.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.116
Oh, great. It's the daughter one.
Do you like her? I like her.

00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:51.661
Why did you do that?
You didn't have to do that!

00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:59.176
Oh, don't be so selfish.
I'm going to miss her, too.

00:31:59.835 --> 00:32:03.135
In fact, you know what,
just for that, I'm leaving.

00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:08.094
Boys, blow up this plane
and, I don't know, Belgium, yeah?

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:15.185
Kill some Belgians, might as well,
they're not even French. Bye.

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:35.420
Well, that's very boring!

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:39.841
He's just going to squish.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.761
What kind of a way is that to die?
That man has no finesse, none.

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.261
It's quite dramatic.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.186
You're an AI interface,
kindly delete your opinions. Thank you.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.814
What's he doing? Is he...

00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:06.611
Oh, no! No, no, now that's...

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:20.837
Oh! Permission to squee!

00:33:49.653 --> 00:33:51.655
Two more to go.
Does it feel any different?

00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:53.365
No.

00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:57.077
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.460
Clara, don't.

00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:06.010
Help me.

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:09.047
If you do what you're trying to do,
if you succeed, he will snap you.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.302
- No.
- And then he will step

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.513
over your broken body, and break
another and another and another.

00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:14.762
- He will never stop.
- I will not harm her.

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:30.277
P.E, P.E.

00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:32.328
Sir.

00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:40.666
I had a friend once.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.918
We ran together, when I was little.

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:44.796
And I thought we were the same.

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:48.420
But when we grew up, we weren't.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.595
Now, she is trying
to tear the world apart,

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:55.894
and I can't run fast enough
to hold it together. The difference...

00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:02.602
...is this. Pain is a gift.

00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:08.320
Without the capacity for pain,
we can't feel the hurt we inflict.

00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:12.449
Are you telling me seriously,
for real that you can?

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:15.872
- Of course I can.
- Then, shame on you, Doctor.

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.164
Yes.

00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:20.000
Oh, yes.

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:30.592
Danny. Danny, I need you to tell me,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.765
what are the clouds going to do,
what is the plan?

00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:37.386
- How would I know?
- You're part of a hive mind now,

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.849
presumably that's how you found Clara.
just look.

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:44.852
- Can't see much.
- Look harder.

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:50.065
Clara, watch this.
This is who the Doctor is.

00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:53.910
Watch the blood-soaked
old general in action.

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:57.956
I can't see properly, sir,
because this needs activating.

00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:02.878
If you want to know what's coming,
you have to switch it on.

00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:08.588
And didn't all of those beautiful
speeches just disappear

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:10.965
in the face of a tactical advantage?

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.381
Sir?

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:28.195
Ahh. I need to know.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.487
I need to know.

00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.987
Yes. Yes, you do.

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:41.366
Give me the screwdriver.

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:44.411
- No.
-just do it, Doctor.

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.831
Do as you are told.

00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:00.010
Typical officer.

00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:02.395
Got to keep those hands clean.

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:14.275
- Just point and think, yeah?
- Yes.

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:17.993
Okay.

00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:27.545
I wasn't very good at it.
But I did love you.

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.627
I loved you, too.

00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:35.842
I'm never going to say that again.

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.340
Me neither.

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:44.976
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.730
It feels like I'm killing you.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.695
I'm already dead.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.698
You're here this time at least.

00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:58.155
Goodbye, Danny.

00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:01.575
Goodbye, Clara.

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.582
Oh...

00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:16.762
Ah, no, no, no. Wait, he's activating.
Clara, step away! No, don't!

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:22.968
Danny, if you can hear me,
if you're still there...

00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:24.849
What are the clouds going to do?

00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:28.899
The rain will fall again.
All humanity will die.

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.944
- And rise again as Cybermen?
- Correct.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:36.944
- How do we stop it?
- We cannot be stopped.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.368
Oh, that was brilliant!

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.790
Well, love the telly here,
but did you see that?

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:53.715
Oh, Clara, you poor thing,
you must feel like death.

00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:55.550
Let me pop away the pain.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.502
Don't you dare! Don't you
even think about it!

00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.259
I'm sorry, hon. I'm just getting
a bit carried away.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.511
It's your friends, they're so moreish.

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:06.432
Hmm. Oh, stop looking all cross-pants.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.600
I'm here to give you your gift.
Could you at least try and be excited?

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.063
What gift?

00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:16.900
Cyberdears!

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:20.946
Look at mummy! Raise your arms.

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.404
Lower your arms. Raise your right.

00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:27.411
Lower your right. Turn on the spot.

00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.626
There are exits at the front
and rear of the aircraft.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.383
Please follow the lights up the aisle.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:41.179
You see, Doctor? The power
to slaughter whole worlds at a time,

00:39:41.254 --> 00:39:43.348
then make them do a safety briefing.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.720
Everyone who ever lived, man, woman,
and child is now at my command.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.852
An indestructible army
to rage across the universe.

00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:54.104
The more they kill,
the more they recruit.

00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:57.779
Happy birthday.

00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:02.905
Oh, you didn't know, did you?

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.204
It's lucky one of us
remembers these things.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.616
Happy birthday,

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.795
# Mr President.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:19.960
Doctor.

00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:21.545
Tiny bit pleased?

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.850
Oh, go on, crack a smile.

00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:29.724
I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.

00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:31.263
All of this...

00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:33.765
All of it, just to give me an army?

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:35.937
Well, I don't need one, do I?

00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:38.603
Armies are for people
who think they're right.

00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:41.406
Nobody thinks they're righter than you.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.238
Give a good man fire-power,

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.073
and he'll never run out
of people to kill.

00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:47.411
I don't want an army!

00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:50.202
Well, that's the trouble! Yes, you do!

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.124
You've always wanted one!

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.373
All those people suffering
in the Dalek camps?

00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:58.502
Now you can save them. All those bad
guys winning all the wars?

00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.504
Go and get the good guys back.

00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:02.676
- Nobody can have that power.
- You will,

00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.379
because you don't have a choice.
There's only

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.469
one way you can stop these clouds
from opening up

00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:10.347
and killing all your
little pets down here.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.389
Conquer the universe, Mr President.

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:16.482
Show a bad girl how it's done.

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.935
Why are you doing this?

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.030
I need you to know
we're not so different.

00:41:24.524 --> 00:41:26.902
I need my friend back.

00:41:27.944 --> 00:41:31.323
Every battle, every war, every invasion,

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:34.329
from now on, you decide the outcome.

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:36.707
What's the matter, Mr President?

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.172
Don't you trust yourself?

00:41:42.792 --> 00:41:43.793
Tell me.

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:46.174
Am I good man?

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.172
Sir!

00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.734
I see into your soul, Doctor.

00:41:59.892 --> 00:42:04.147
I see hatred!

00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:07.817
I'm not a hero!

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.325
You are a good Dalek!

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:21.081
Thank you. Thank you, so much.

00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:26.302
I really didn't know. I wasn't sure.
You lose sight sometimes.

00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:27.796
Thank you.

00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:31.765
I am not a good man.

00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:36.812
And I'm not a bad man.

00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:39.311
I'm not a hero.

00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:44.442
I'm definitely not a president.
And, no, I'm not an officer.

00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.148
You know what I am?

00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:50.156
I am an idiot,

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.780
with a box and a screwdriver.

00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:58.539
Passing through, helping out. Learning.

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.999
I don't need an army, I never have.
'Cause I've got them.

00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:03.123
Always them.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:06.005
Because, love, it's not an emotion.

00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:08.715
Love is a promise,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.434
and he will never hurt her.

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.469
P.E., catch!

00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:21.649
You didn't notice, did you?

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:23.601
While you were doing
all your silly orders,

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:25.069
while you were showing off,

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.480
the one soldier not obeying.

00:43:26.896 --> 00:43:28.398
No, that's wrong. That's impossible.

00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:32.076
The rain will not fall.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.116
Oh? Why won't it?

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.617
The clouds will burn.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.874
- And who'll burn them?
- I will burn them.

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.200
How?

00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:41.164
I will burn.

00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:44.964
One burning Cyberman is hardly
going to save the planet.

00:43:46.499 --> 00:43:47.500
Correct.

00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:53.631
Attention!

00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.472
This is not a good day.

00:43:57.844 --> 00:43:59.892
This is Earth's darkest hour.

00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:03.016
And look at you miserable lot.

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:07.358
We are the fallen.
But today we shall rise.

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:09.401
The army of the dead,

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.653
will save the land of the living.

00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:14.069
This is not the order of a general.

00:44:15.528 --> 00:44:17.826
- Nor the whim of a lunatic...
- Excuse me!

00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:19.828
This is a promise!

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.077
The promise of a soldier!

00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:28.250
You will sleep safe tonight.

00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.422
Well.

00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:20.264
- The clouds have all gone.
- Yes.

00:45:21.135 --> 00:45:23.638
Burned up, totally burned.

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.148
Burned to nothing.

00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:32.234
Sorry.

00:45:32.605 --> 00:45:35.825
10-0-11-0-0 by 0-2.

00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.572
What did you say?

00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:40.447
The current co-ordinates of Gallifrey.

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:43.870
It's returned to its original location.
Didn't you ever think to look?

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.951
You are lying.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.414
We can go together. Just you and me,
just like the old days.

00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:51.124
You'll be clapped in irons.

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:53.000
If you like.

00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:56.596
Doctor, I'm assuming you'll
remember those co-ordinates?

00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.298
No. Don't you dare, I won't let you.

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:01.100
Old friend, is she?

00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:04.596
If you've ever let this creature live,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.438
everything that happened today
is on you.

00:46:06.973 --> 00:46:08.646
All of it, on you.

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:12.103
And you are not
gonna let her live again.

00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:13.187
Clara,

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.154
all I'm doing,
is not letting you kill her.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.073
I never said I was letting her live.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.747
Really?

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:28.711
If it's the only thing
that will stop you, yes.

00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:41.340
Seriously?

00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:46.471
Oh, Doctor.

00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:49.769
To save her soul?

00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:58.737
But who, my dear, will save yours?

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.078
Say something nice.

00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:10.202
Please.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.082
You win.

00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:16.876
I know.

00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:33.984
Doctor!

00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:42.823
Kate!

00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:45.283
She's breathing.

00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:47.573
She's alive! She can't be here!

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:48.870
She is.

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:50.576
She fell out of a plane.

00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:55.089
The Cyberman...

00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:57.466
Must have caught her.

00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:02.380
Doctor. She's talking about her dad!

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:08.470
Of course!

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.930
The Earth's darkest hour, and mine.

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:13.857
Where else would you be?

00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:31.076
Thank you.

00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:48.434
Clara.

00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.221
Clara.

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:54.598
Danny.

00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:57.731
Danny?

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.937
Is that you?

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.231
Please say it's you.

00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:09.326
Clara.

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:11.040
The Doctor told me about the bracelet.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.246
How it can let Missy travel
from one world to the other.

00:49:13.576 --> 00:49:15.328
This place is dying now.

00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.331
Yes, but the bracelet
can bring you home.

00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:20.382
There's only enough power for one trip.

00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:23.093
Then come on, hurry up!

00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:24.591
Just one trip.

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.384
One trip, one person.

00:49:31.427 --> 00:49:32.974
Danny!

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:43.488
You need to find his parents.

00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:46.450
He died a long time ago.

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:53.157
I'm sorry, Clara.

00:49:53.324 --> 00:49:54.792
I truly am.

00:49:56.368 --> 00:49:58.462
I had... I had promises to keep.

00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.691
- Hey. I got your message.
- Hey.

00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:20.400
- Two weeks late.
- Not bad.

00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:21.477
Improving.

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:25.940
- I see you've got news for me.
- News?

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:26.982
He figured it out then.

00:50:28.234 --> 00:50:30.612
P.E., figured out there was a way home.

00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:32.784
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.703
Oh, good old P.E.

00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:36.576
He'll make a maths teacher yet.

00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:38.915
Listen, Doctor. There's...

00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:42.624
There's something that
I have to tell you. And, um,

00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:45.797
it's not a good news, so...

00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:47.636
- So just listen, okay?
- I know.

00:50:49.797 --> 00:50:50.798
Sorry?

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.303
I know exactly
what you've got to tell me.

00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:55.595
- You... You do?
- You and Danny are together now.

00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:57.351
That's great, that's how it should be.

00:50:57.429 --> 00:51:00.933
But the old man and the blue box,
that's never gonna fit in.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.149
So no more flying around,
no more lying.

00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:05.980
No, that's not exactly...

00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:07.944
- It's fine.
- No, it's not fine.

00:51:08.566 --> 00:51:11.240
It really isn't fine.

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:13.029
I found Gallifrey!

00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:17.624
Wow!

00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.036
Oh, my God!

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:28.461
I entered the co-ordinates,
just like she said.

00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:32.223
And I found Gallifrey.

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:48.147
For once, she wasn't lying.

00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:48.086
So what are you gonna do now?

00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:52.211
- Go home.
- Okay.

00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.761
Gallifrey can be a good place.

00:52:56.632 --> 00:52:58.054
I can help make it that.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.927
- What. you?
- Shut Up!

00:53:00.052 --> 00:53:01.929
You won't just steal
the Tardis and run away?

00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:04.519
No, not this time. Never again.

00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:09.728
Never again.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.949
It's a long commute,
so, you know, I thought,

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.197
-with you and Danny...
- Yeah.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.361
Me and Danny.

00:53:23.742 --> 00:53:25.744
Me and Danny, we are gonna be fine.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.043
Don't you worry. You go home.

00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:31.212
Go home.

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:33.632
Go be a king, or something.

00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:36.429
Yeah, I might do that.

00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:38.390
Or queen, you know. Whatever.

00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:41.302
Yeah, queen, that would be good, too.

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.860
Tell you what. Seeing as it's goodbye,
shall we break a habit?

00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:55.444
What, what habit?

00:53:57.526 --> 00:53:58.527
Hug?

00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:00.529
Why not.

00:54:00.946 --> 00:54:02.368
Within reason.

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:08.336
Come on, you're on the clock.

00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:10.665
Fair enough.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.308
Why don't you like hugging, Doctor?

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.148
Never trust a hug.

00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:31.728
It's just a way to hide your face.

00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:37.608
Yeah.

00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:45.999
Doctor?

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:49.829
Travelling with you
made me feel really special.

00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:54.879
Thank you for that.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.804
Thank you for making me feel special.

00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:01.340
Thank you, for exactly the same.

00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:43.344
Coo-wee.

00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:46.681
Hello!

00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:50.814
Doctor, you know it can't end like that!

00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:52.140
Hmm.

00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.810
We need to get this sorted, and quickly.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.562
She's not all right, you know.

00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:58.488
And neither are you!

00:55:58.564 --> 00:56:00.111
I'm coming in.

00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:02.151
Ah! There you are!

00:56:02.442 --> 00:56:04.410
I knew I'd get round to you eventually.

00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:06.739
Now, stop gawping, and tell me.

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.658
What do you want for Christmas?
